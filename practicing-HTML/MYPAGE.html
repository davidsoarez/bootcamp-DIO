                    I am the type of person who loves to learn new things especially when it comes to new technologies. 
                    Born in the early 90s, I was able to follow the exponential evolution of the internet and enjoy each 
                    new technology as a user. Today, aligning my passion for technology with the opportunities available, 
                    I seek new professional challenges in a career migration as a developer.

                    After a few years trying to find ways to undertake and trying to develop projects that would lead me to the path of success 
                    on this journey, I realized that in fact my skills were enhanced in third party projects, thus being able to be more creative 
                    in developing ideas that would improve processes and projects already existing.
                        
                    From this perception, I have the opportunity to work at Kolme Engenharia, where I developed skills in areas that were outside 
                    my comfort zone and that until now were unknown, such as the commercial / sales sector and later the administrative sector. 
                    Prospecting for new contracts, relationship with customers and sales objectives, financial reports, supplier payments and 
                    invoice control, were activities that were part of my daily life.
                        
                    In a second moment, I gained access to the universe of trade marketing, through the opportunity gained at RT Representações, 
                    where I was able to have contact with new challenges aimed at gaining efficiency in the external team of sales promoters. 
                    Preparation of performance reports, action plans and data analysis aimed at identifying and solving bottlenecks in the 
                    operation, which is part of my daily life.
                        
                    At RT Representações, I was part of the direct team responsible for winning the AEX 2019 award for Best Merchandising 
                    company in Brazil, category up to 200 promoters, not considered the largest Trade Marketing event in Latin America, given 
                    by Involves Stage. .
